## Auto-Translate Chat Application 

- Opensource Internship Project
</br>

### Intro 
- Tool: An application that allows automatic translation of message to a user's preferred language
</br>

- Goal: Bridge language barriers in chat communication by providing real-time auto-translation of 
messages
</br>

- Example: Perhaps there are two people; one whose native language is Spanish and a 
friend who speaks French. To facilitate fast and efficient communication, the two individuals 
have to be good at both languages. In an instance where User A is not fluent in User B’s language
(or vice versa), Penpal aims to help both users achieve the same level of efficiency in their 
communication by providing real-time translation. This would help both of them communicate while 
also saving them time that would have been spent in manually translating each other’s messages 
into their respective languages.
